Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Title: Doctor Appointment Booking & Consultation Portal
The **Doctor Appointment Booking & Consultation Portal** is a full-stack web application designed
to provide an easy and efficient way for patients to book doctor appointments and consult online.
The portal aims to provide an interactive, user-friendly, and responsive interface accessible to all
users. The project will include a dedicated database, a React-based frontend, and Python-based
backend logic for CRUD operations. The application will have three distinct user roles: Doctor,
Patient, and Admin (system owner). The interface inspiration is drawn from Practo’s design
philosophy (https://www.practo.com/consult) to ensure a clean, intuitive, and engaging experience.
